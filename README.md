# Overview

This mobile app is designed to help users manage their pantry and recipes efficiently. Users can view pantry items, search for items, and edit or delete existing entries. The app also allows for adding recipes and organizing ingredients, making meal planning and shopping more convenient.

To use the app, users navigate through the bottom tab menu, which includes a Pantry view and a Recipes view. In the Pantry view, items can be searched, edited, or deleted. In the Recipes view, users can browse, view, and organize recipes. Each feature responds to user input in real-time and stores data locally so it persists even when the app is closed.

The purpose of creating this app was to enhance my skills as a software engineer in building cross-platform mobile applications using React Native and Expo. This project helped to enhance my abilities to understand and execute core functionality, state management, and data persistence.

# Development Environment

The app was developed using Visual Studio Code and Expo to streamline cross-platform mobile development for both Android and iOS. I utilized Android Stuido, and setup an emulation for an Android device. I also downloaded the Expo GO app on iOS to test physically on an iPhone. 

**Programming language:** TypeScript with React Native. 

**Libraries used:**  
* `expo-router` for navigation  
* `react-native` for UI components  
* `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for local data persistence  
* `uuid` for generating unique IDs for pantry items  
* `@expo/vector-icons` for icons  

# Useful Websites

* [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) – official guide for React Native components and APIs  
* [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) – guidance on using Expo features, navigation, and building apps  
* [AsyncStorage Documentation](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/install/) – for data persistence in React Native apps  
* [UUID GitHub](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) – for generating unique identifiers in JavaScript/TypeScript  

# Future Work

* Add user authentication and cloud storage to sync data across devices.

* Add the ability to include photos/video of food and the cooking process.

* Improve the UI/UX design, including custom styling, animations, and better feedback for user actions.

* Implement advanced search and filtering options for pantry items and recipes, including lists and groups/categories.
